st.markdown("""
In our household, we've often debated the merits of **renting vs. buying**â€”but found that most online calculators were lacking.

They typically overlook how **savings rate and investment growth** are truly affected by each scenario. So we built this tool to do better:

- âœ… It **models the total impact on net worth**, where for homeownership, net worth is always considered *after a potential sale*.
- ðŸ“ˆ To reflect more realistic long-term asset performance, we've added a **Monte Carlo simulation** for stock and cash portfolio letting us 
            see the **opportunity cost of the down payment**â€”and how it might affect your future wealth.
